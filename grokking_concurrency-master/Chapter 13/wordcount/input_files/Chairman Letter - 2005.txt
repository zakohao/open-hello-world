 Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companie s to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was prev iously the requirement.  In this table, Berkshire’s results through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s.  In all other respects, the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. 
The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax.  If a corporation such as Berkshire were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index showed a negative return.  Over the years, the tax cost s would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial.
  
BER KSHIR E HATHAWAY  INC. 
 
 
To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hath away Inc. : 
 
 Our gain in net worth du ring 2005 was $5.6 billion, which increased  the per-share book  value of 
both our Class A an d Class B stock by 6.4%.  Over the last 41 y ears (that is, since present  managem ent 
took over) book value has grown from  $19 t o $59,377, a rate of 21.5% c ompounded annually.* 
 
 Berkshire ha d a decent year in 2005.  We initiated five acquisitions (two of whic h have yet to  
close) an d most of ou r operating su bsidiaries pros pered.  Even o ur insurance b usiness in its entirety did 
well, th ough Hurrican e Kat rina in flicted  record  losses on both Berk shire an d the indu stry.  We estim ate our 
loss fro m Katrin a at $2.5 billion – and  her ugly sisters, Rit a and Wilma, co st us an additional $.9 billion.  
 
 Cred it GEICO – and its brillian t CEO, To ny Nicely –  for our stellar in surance resu lts in a d isaster-
ridden year.  One statistic stan ds out: In  just two  years, GEICO im proved its p roductivity b y 32%.  
Remarkabl y, employment fell by 4% eve n as pol icy count grew by 26% – an d more gai ns are i n store.  
When we dri ve un it co sts d own in such a dram atic manner, we can offer ever-greater value to our 
customers.  The payoff: Last year, GEICO gained market-share, earned commenda ble profits and 
strengthened its brand.  If you have a new son or grandson in 2006, name him Tony . 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 My g oal in writin g this report is to  give you the info rmatio n you need to estimate Berk shire’s 
intrinsic value .  I say  “estimate” becaus e calculations  of intrinsic value, t hough all-im porta nt, are  
necessa rily impreci se and often seriously wrong.  The  more unce rtain the future of a business, the more 
possibility th ere is th at the calculation will b e wild ly off-base.  (Fo r an explanation  of intrinsic v alue, see 
page s 77 – 78.)  Here B erkshire has s ome adva ntages: a wide vari ety of relatively-stable earni ngs streams, 
combined with great  liquidity and minimum debt.  These factors m ean that Berks hire’s in trinsic v alue can  
be m ore precis ely calculated than can th e intrinsic value of m ost companies. 
 
 Yet if preci sion is aided by Berkshire’s financial ch aracteristics, th e job o f calcu lating in trinsic 
value has bee n made more com plex by the mere prese nce of s o many earni ngs st reams.  Back i n 1965, 
when we own ed only a sm all textile o peration , the task  of calcu lating intrinsic v alue was a sn ap.  No w we 
own 68 distinct businesses  with widely disparat e operating and financial charact eristics.  T his array of 
unrelated enterprises, coupled with our massive invest ment holdings, makes i t impossi ble for you to simply 
examine our consolidated financial state ments and arriv e at an  informed estimate of intrinsic value. 
 
 We h ave at tempted to ease t his problem by clustering our businesses into four logical groups, each 
of which we discu ss later in  this repo rt.  In th ese d iscussions, we will p rovide the key figures for bo th the 
group and its important com ponents.  Of course, the value of B erkshire may be ei ther great er or less than 
the sum  of these fo ur parts.  The o utcome depen ds on whether o ur many units function better or worse by 
being part of a larger e nterprise and whether capi tal allocation improves or deteriorates wh en it is un der the 
direction of a holding company.  In other words, does Berkshire ownership bring anything to the party, or 
would our s harehol ders be better off if they directly owne d sha res in each  of our 68 busi nesses ?  These are 
important questio ns but ones that you  will h ave to answer for you rself. 
 
 Before we look at our individual businesses, however, let’s review two sets of figures that show 
where we ’ve c ome from  and whe re we are now.  The fi rst set is the am ount of invest ments (including cash 
and cash-equivalents) we o wn on a per-share basi s.  In making this calculation, we excl ude investments 
held in our fina nce ope ration because these are largely offs et by borrowi ngs:

the company had  outstan ding before 1996.  The B shares hav e an econ omic interest equal to  1/30th that of 
the A.

 When growth  rates are un der discussion , it will pay you  to be suspicious as to  why the beginning 
and term inal years h ave been selected .  If eith er year was aberratio nal, an y calcu lation of growth  will be 
distorted.  In part icular, a base y ear i n whi ch ear nings were poor can produce a breat htaking, but 
meaningless, growth rate.  In the table above, however, the base year of 1965 was abnormally good; 
Berk shire earned  more money in that year th an it d id in all bu t one of the previous ten. 
 
 As you can see f rom the two tab les, the com parative growth rates of Berkshire’s two elements of 
value have change d in the last decade, a  result re flecting our e ver-increasi ng em phasis on business  
acquisition s.  Nev ertheless, Ch arlie Mu nger, Berk shire’s Vice Ch airman and my p artner, and  I wan t to 
increase t he figures i n both tables.  In this ambition, we hope – metaphori cally – to avoid the fate of the 
elderly couple who had been  rom antically challenged for some time.  As they finished dinner on their 50th 
anniversa ry, however, the wife – st imulated by  soft music, wi ne and candlelight – felt a long-absent tickle 
and demurely suggested to her husband that they go u pstairs and m ake love.  He ag onized f or a m oment 
and then replied, “I can do one or the other, but not both.” 
 
Acquisiti ons 
 
 Over the years, our current businesses, in aggregate, should del iver modest growth in operating 
earnings.  Bu t they will n ot in themselves produce tru ly satisfacto ry gains.  We will n eed major acq uisitions 
to get that job done. 
 
 In this quest, 2005 was encouraging.  We agreed  to five purch ases: two  that were co mpleted  last 
year, one that closed after ye arend a nd two others that we expect  to cl ose soon.  None of the deals invo lve 
the issuance of Berkshi re sha res.  That ’s a c rucial, but often ignored, point: Whe n a managem ent proudly 
acqui res a nother company for stock, the shareholders of the acquirer are concurrently selling part of their 
interest in  everyth ing they own.  I’ve made this kind of deal a few times myse lf – and, on balance, my 
actions have cost you money . 
 
 4 Here  are last y ear’s  purchases :  
 
• On June 3 0 we bo ught Medical Protective Com pany (“MedPro”), a 106-year- old medical 
malp ractice insurer b ased in Fort Wayne.  Malp ractice insura nce is tough to underwri te and has 
proved to be a graveyard  for many insurers.  Med Pro nevertheless shou ld do well.  It will h ave the 
attitu dinal advantage that all Berk shire in surers share, wherein  underwri ting discipline trumps all 
other goals.  Additionally, as part of Berk shire, MedPro has financial streng th far ex ceeding that of 
its co mpetitors, a quality assu ring doctors t hat lon g-to-set tle clai ms will not end up back on their 
doorstep because their ins urer failed.  Fi nally, the com pany has a sm art and e nergetic CEO, Tim 
Kenesey, who instinctively thin ks like a Berk shire manager. 
 
• Forest Riv er, our seco nd acquisition , closed on Augu st 31.  A co uple of months earlier, on  June 
21, I recei ved a two-pa ge fa x telling me – point by point – why Forest River m et the ac quisition 
criteria we set  fort h on page 25 o f this report.  I ha d not  before he ard of the co mpany, a 
recreation al vehicle manufacturer with  $1.6 billion of sales, nor of Pete Lieg l, its owner and 
manager .  But the fax made sense, a nd I immediately asked for m ore figures.  T hese ca me the next  
morning, and that afternoon I made Pet e an offer.  On June 28, we shook hands on a deal. 
 
Pete is a remarkable en trepreneur.  So me years back, he sold his business, then far smaller than 
today, to a n LBO operat or who prom ptly bega n telling him how to run th e place.  Before long, 
Pete left, and the business soon sunk into bankruptcy.  Pete then repurchased i t.  You can be sure 
that I won’t be telling Pet e how to manage hi s operation. 
 
Forest River has 60 plants, 5,400 em ployees and has c onsistently gained share in the RV business, 
while also e xpandi ng into other areas s uch as boats .  Pete is 61 – and definitely in an acceleration 
mode.  Read the piece from  RV Business  that accom panies this report , and you’ll see why Pete and 
Berks hire are made for ea ch other. 
 
• On November 12, 2005, an article ran  in The Wall Street Journal deal ing with Berkshire’s unusual 
acquisition  and managerial practices.  In  it Pete d eclared, “It was easier to  sell my b usiness th an to 
renew my driver’s license.” 
 
In New Yo rk, Cath y Baro n Tamraz read  the article, and it struc k a chord.  On Novem ber 21, she 
sent m e a letter that  began, “As  president  of Business Wire, I’d lik e to introduce you to my 
company, as I believe it fits th e profile o f Berkshire Hath away sub sidiary companies as d etailed  in 
a recen t Wall Street Jou rnal article.” 
 
By th e time I finished Cathy’s two-p age letter, I felt Busi ness Wire  and Berk shire  were a fit.  I 
particula rly lik ed her penultimate paragra ph: “We run a tight shi p and keep  unnecessary spendi ng 
under wraps.  No secret aries or m anagem ent layers he re.  Yet  we’ll invest big dollars to gain a 
technological a dvantage  and move the busi ness forward.” 
 
I prom ptly gave Cathy a call, and before l ong Berks hire had reache d agreem ent with Busi ness 
Wire’s controlling shareholder, Lorry Lokey, who founded the com pany in 1961 (and who had 
just made Cathy CEO).  I love success st ories like Lorry’s.  Today  78, he  has built a com pany t hat 
dissem inates inf ormation in 150 co untries for 25,000 clients.  Hi s story, like those of m any 
entrepreneurs who have sel ected B erkshire as a hom e for their life’s work, is  an exam ple of what  
can happe n when a good i dea, a talented  individual and hard work converge. 
 
• In Decem ber we agreed to buy 81% of Applied Underwriters, a  com pany that offe rs a combination 
of pay roll services a nd workers’ compensation insurance to small businesses.   A majority of 
Applied’s c ustomers are located in Californ ia. 
 
 
 
 5In 1998, though, when the company had 12 em ployees, it acqui red a n Om aha-base d operation 
with 24 em ployees that offe red a som ewhat-similar service.  Sid Ferenc and St eve Menzies, wh o 
have built App lied’s remarkable bu siness, co ncluded that O maha had many advantages as an 
operation al base – a brillia nt insight, I might add  – and tod ay 400  of the co mpany’s 479 
employees are located here . 
 
Less than a year ago, Appl ied entere d into a large rein suran ce con tract with  Ajit Jain , the 
extraordinary manager of Natio nal Ind emnity’s re insuran ce division.  Ajit was im pressed  by Sid 
and Steve, a nd they liked Berk shire’s method of operation.  So  we decide d to join forces .  We are 
pleased that Si d and Steve  retain 19% of Applied.  They started on a s hoestring only 12  years ago , 
and it will b e fun to see what they can  accom plish with Berk shire’s backing. 
 
• Last spri ng, MidAm erican Ener gy, our 80.5% owned subsidiary, agreed t o buy PacifiCorp, a 
major electric u tility serv ing six Western states.  An acquisition  of this so rt requires m any 
regulatory approvals, bu t we’ve now obtained these and expect to close this tran sactio n soon . 
Berk shire will then buy $3.4 billion of MidAm erican ’s commo n stock, which MidAmerican  will 
supplement with  $1.7 billion of borro wing to complete th e purchase.  You can’t ex pect to earn 
outsized  profits in  regulated utilities, b ut the in dustry offers own ers the opportun ity to  deploy large 
sums at fai r returns – an d therefore, it makes go od se nse for Berks hire.  A few years back, I said 
that we hoped to make some very larg e purchases in the utility field .  No te the plural – we’ll b e 
looking for more. 
 
 In addition to buying these new op eration s, we co ntinue to make “bolt-on” acquisition s.  So me 
aren’t so sm all: Sh aw, our  carpet operation , spent abou t $550 million last year  on two pu rchases that 
furth ered its vertical in tegration and shou ld improve its profit m argin in th e future.  XTRA and  Clayto n 
Hom es also m ade value-enhancing acquisitions. 
 
 Unlike many business buyers, Berkshire has no “exi t strategy.”  We buy to keep .  We do, though, 
have an entrance strateg y, look ing for businesses in  this coun try or abroad that meet our s ix criteria and are 
availab le at a p rice th at will p roduce a reaso nable return.  If you  have a business that fits, g ive me a call.   
Like a hopeful teenage girl, I’ll b e waitin g by the phone. 
 
Insur ance 
 
 Let’s now  talk abo ut our four sector s and  start with insuran ce, our core business.  What coun ts 
here is the am ount of “fl oat” and its cost over tim e. 
 
 For new rea ders, let m e explain.  “Floa t” is money that do esn’t belo ng to us but that we 
temporarily hold.  Most of our fl oat arises because (1) pre miums are pa id upfront though  the servic e we  
provide – insurance protection – i s delivered over a pe riod that usual ly cove rs a y ear and; (2) loss events 
that occur toda y do not always resu lt in our immediately p aying claim s, because it sometim es takes many 
years for lo sses to  be repo rted (asb estos lo sses wou ld be an example), negotiated  and settled .  Th e $20 
million of flo at that ca me with our 1967 entry in to insurance has n ow increased – both by way  of internal 
growth and acquisition s – to $49 billion. 
 
 Float is wonderful – if it doesn’t come at a high price.  Its co st is d etermined by underwritin g 
results, m eaning how th e expen ses an d losses we will ultimatel y pay com pare with  the premiums we h ave 
receive d.  Whe n an insurer earns a n unde rwriting profit – as has been t he case at Be rkshire in a bout hal f of 
the 39 y ears we ha ve bee n in the insurance b usiness – float is b etter th an free.  In su ch years, we are  
actually paid for holding other people’s money .  Fo r most insure rs, howeve r, life  has bee n far more 
diffic ult: In aggre gate, the prope rty-casualty indust ry alm ost inva riably operates at an underwriting l oss.  
When that loss is larg e, float becomes exp ensive, sometimes devastatin gly so. 
 
 
 
 6 In 2004 our float cost  us less than nothing, and I told you that we had a chance  – absent a mega-
catastrophe – of no-cost float in 200 5.  B ut we had the mega-cat, and as a specialis t in that coverage, 
Berk shire suffered  hurrican e losses o f $3.4 billion.  Nev ertheless, o ur float was costless in 2005 because of 
the superb results we had in our other insurance activ ities, particularly at GEIC O. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 Auto policies in force gre w by 12.1% at GE ICO, a gain i ncreasing its m arket s hare of U.S. private 
passe nger aut o busi ness f rom about 5.6% t o about 6.1%.  Aut o insurance is a bi g business:  Each s hare-
point equates to $1.6 billion in sales. 
 
 While ou r brand streng th is not quantifiab le, I b elieve it also  grew sign ifican tly.  W hen Berk shire 
acqui red c ontrol of GEICO in 1996, its annual advertising expenditures were $31 m illion.  Last  year we 
were up  to $502 million.  And I can ’t wait to spend more. 
 
 Our adve rtising works because we ha ve a great  story to tell: More pe ople can sa ve money by 
insuring  with  us than is th e case with  any other national carrier offering  policies to  all co mers.  (So me 
specialized aut o insure rs do partic ularly well for a pplicants fitting i nto their niches; also, because our  
national competitors use rati ng system s that differ from ours, they will so metimes b eat o ur price.)  Last 
year, we ac hieved by far the highest conversion rate – the perce ntage of internet and phone quotes turned 
into sales – in ou r history.  This is po werfu l evidence that our prices a re more attract ive relativ e to the 
competitio n than ever before.  Test us by going to GEIC O.co m or by callin g 800-847-7536.  Be su re to 
indicate you  are a sh areholder because that fact will o ften qualify you  for a discount. 
 
 I told you last year abo ut GEICO’s en try into  New Jersey in  August, 2004.  Drivers in that state 
love us.  Our retention rate there for new policyholders is running higher than in any other state, an d by 
sometime in  2007, GEIC O is likely to  become the third largest au to insu rer in New Jersey.  There, as 
elsewh ere, our low co sts allow low prices that lead  to steady g ains in profitab le business. 
 
 That simple form ula im mediately impressed m e 55 y ears ago when I first discovered GEIC O.  
Indeed, at age 21, I wrote an article about the company – it’s reproduced on page 24 – when its market 
value was $ 7 million.  As y ou can see , I cal led GE ICO “T he Sec urity I Like B est.”  An d that’s what I still 
call it.

 We ha ve m ajor reins urance operatio ns at G eneral Re and National Indemnity.  The fo rmer is run 
by Joe Brandon and Tad Montross, the latter by Ajit Jain.  Bo th un its performed well in  2005 considering 
the extraordinary hu rrican e losses th at battered  the ind ustry. 
 
 It’s a n open question whet her atm ospheric, ocea nic or other causal factors ha ve dra matically 
change d the freque ncy or int ensity of hurri canes.  R ecent expe rience is worris ome.  We know, for ins tance, 
that in  the 100  year s before 2004, abou t 59 hurricanes of Catego ry 3 strength, or  greater , hit th e 
Southeastern a nd Gulf Coast states, and that  only three of these we re Catego ry 5s.  We f urther k now that in 
2004 there were three C ategory 3 storms that ham mered those areas  and that these were foll owed by four 
more in 2005, one of them, Katrina, the most destructive hurricane in industry history.  Mor eover, there 
were th ree Categ ory 5s near th e coast last ye ar that fortunat ely weak ened before landfall. 
 
 Was t his on slaught of more frequ ent and  more in tense sto rms merely an anomaly?  Or was it 
cause d by changes in climate, wat er temperature or other variables we don’t fully understand?  And could 
these fact ors be d eveloping in a manner that will soo n prod uce disasters dwarfing Katrina?  
 
 Joe, Ajit and I don’t know the an swer t o these all-i mportant questio ns.  What  we do k now is that 
our ign orance means we must fo llow th e course prescrib ed by Pascal in  his fam ous wag er abou t the 
existence o f God.  As y ou may recal l, he concl uded that since he di dn’t know the answer, his per sonal 
gain/loss ratio dictated  an affirmative conclusion. 
 
 
 7 So guided, we’ve concluded that we s hould now write mega-cat  policies onl y at prices f ar higher 
than prev ailed  last year –  and then only with  an aggregate expos ure that woul d not cau se us distres s if shifts  
in some important variable produ ce far m ore co stly sto rms in  the near future.  To  a lesser d egree, we felt 
this way  after 2004 – and cut back our writings when prices didn’t move.  No w our caution has i ntensified.  
If prices seem  appropriate, howev er, we contin ue to have both the ability an d the app etite to  be the larges t 
writer of mega-cat  coverage in the world.

 Our sm aller in surers, with MedPro added to the fold, delivered  truly outstan ding results last year.  
Howe ver, what you see in the  table be low does not do full jus tice to their perform ance.  That’s because  we 
increased  the l oss reserv es of MedPro by about $125 million immed iately after our purchase. 
 
 No one knows with any precisio n what amo unt will be required to  pay the claim s we in herited.  
Medical malpractice insura nce is a “l ong-tai l” line, meaning that claim s often take m any years to settle.  In  
addition, there are o ther losses th at have occurred, but that we won ’t even hear abou t for some time.  On e 
thing, though, we h ave learn ed – the hard way –  after m any years in  the business: Su rprises in  insuran ce are 
far from symmetr ical.  Y ou ar e lucky if yo u get one that is pleasan t for ev ery ten th at go the other way.  
Too often, howeve r, insurers react to  loom ing loss  proble ms with optim ism.  They be have like  the fellow in 
a swi tchblade fight who, after his opponent has t aken a  mighty swipe at his throat, excl aimed, “Y ou never 
touched me.”  H is adversary ’s rep ly: “Ju st wait until yo u try to  shake your head.” 
 
 Excluding the reser ves we a dded for prior periods, MedPro wrote at an underwriting profit.  And 
our other primary com panies, in aggregate, had a n underwriting profit of $324 million on $1,270 m illion of 
volume.  Th is is an  extraordinary result, and ou r thanks go  to Rod Eldred of Berk shire Hathaway  
Homestate Co mpanies, Joh n Kizer of Cen tral States In demnity, To m Nern ey of U. S. Liability, Don  Towle

 We ha ve an 80.5% (fully diluted) interest in MidAm erican Ene rgy Holdings, which owns a wide 
variety o f utility o peration s.  The larg est of these are (1 ) Yorkshire Electricity  and Northern Electric, wh ose 
3.7 million electric cu stomers m ake it t he third larg est d istribu tor of electricity in  the U.K.; (2) 
MidAm erican Energy, whic h serves 706,000 electric customers,  primarily in Iowa; an d (3) Kern  River and 
Northern Natural pipelines, w hich car ry 7.8% of the natural gas co nsum ed in the U.S.  Whe n our Paci fiCorp 
acquisition  closes, we will ad d 1.6 million electric cu stomers in six Western  states, with Orego n and Utah 
providing us the most business.  Th is tran sactio n will increase Mid American ’s rev enues by $3.3 billion and  
its assets b y $14.1 billion. 
 
 
 
 
 
 8 The Pub lic Utili ty Ho lding Co mpany Act (“PUHC A”) was rep ealed o n Aug ust 8, 2 005, a 
milesto ne that allo wed Berk shire to  convert its Mid American p referred stock i nto voting com mon share s on 
February 9, 2 006.  Thi s conversion ended a con voluted corporate arrangem ent that PUHC A ha d forced  
upon us.  No w we have 83.4% of b oth the com mon st ock and t he votes at MidAm erican, w hich allows us 
to cons olidate the com pany’s inc ome for fina ncial accounting a nd tax purposes .  Our true ec onom ic 
interest, howe ver, is the aforem entioned 80.5%, since t here are options outstanding that are sure t o be 
exercised  within a few years an d that upon exercise will d ilute our ownership. 
 
 Though our voting pow er has in creased  dramatically, the dynamics of our four-party ownership 
have  not changed at all.  We view M idAm erican as a  partnership am ong Berkshire, Walter Scott, and two 
terrific m anagers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel.  It’s unimportant how many votes each party has; we  will 
make major m oves only whe n we a re unanimous i n thinking them wise.  Five years o f working with Dave , 
Greg and Walter have  underscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn’t have better partners. 
 
 You will n otice th at this year  we h ave provided you with  two balance sheets, o ne representing our 
actual figures per GAAP on Decem ber 31, 2005 (which does not consolidate MidAm erican) a nd one  that 
reflects th e sub sequent conversion  of our preferred .  All fu ture fin ancial repo rts of Berk shire will in clude 
MidAm erican’s figures. 
 
 Somewhat incongruously, Mid American owns the seco nd largest real estate b rokerage firm  in the 
U.S.  And it’s a gem .  The parent com pany’s nam e is HomeServices of  America, bu t our 19,200 agen ts 
operate through 18 locally-branded firms.  Aided by three small acqui sitions, we participated in $64 billion 
of transactions last year, u p 6.5% from 2004. 
 
 Currently, th e white-ho t market in residential real estate of rece nt years i s cool ing down, and that 
should lead  to ad ditional acqu isition possibilities fo r us.  Both we and  Ron Peltier, t he company’s CEO,  
expect Hom eServices to be fa r larger a deca de from  now.

 9Finance  and F inancial Prod ucts 
 
 The st ar of our finance s ector is Clayton Homes, masterful ly run by Kevin Clayton.  He does not 
owe his brillian t reco rd to a rising tide: The manufactured-housing business has been disappo inting since 
Berks hire purc hased Clayton in 2003.  Indus try sales have  stagnate d at 40-year lows, a nd the recent uptick  
from  Katrina-related dem and will alm ost certainly be  short-live d.  In rece nt years, m any industry  
participants have suffered losses, and only Clayton ha s earned significant money . 
 
 In this brutal e nvironm ent Clayton has bought a large am ount of manufac tured-housi ng loans from  
major banks that found them unp rofitable and difficult to servi ce.  Clayton’s operating ex pertise and 
Berkshire’s financi al resources have m ade this an exce llent busi ness fo r us a nd one in whi ch we are 
preeminent.  We presen tly serv ice $17  billion of loans, com pared to $5.4 billon at th e time o f our purchase.  
Moreover, Clayto n now own s $9.6 billion of its serv icing  portfolio, a position built up almost entirely sin ce 
Berk shire en tered  the picture. 
 
 To finance th is portfolio, Clayto n borrows money fro m Berkshire, wh ich in turn borrows th e sam e 
amount publicly.  For t he use of its credit, Berkshire charges Clayton a o ne percent age-point markup on its 
borrowing cos t.  In 2 005, the cost  to Clayton for this arrangem ent was $ 83 million.  That  amount is 
included in “Other” income in the table on t he faci ng page, and C layton’s earni ngs of $416 m illion are aft er 
deducting  this payment. 
 
 On the manufacturing side, Clayton has also b een activ e.  To  its o riginal base of twen ty plants, it 
first added twelve more in 2004 by way  of the ban kruptcy purchase of O akwood, which just  a few years 
earlier wa s one  of the la rgest companies in t he business.  Then in 2005 Clayton purchased Karst en, a four-
plant operation th at greatly stren gthens Clayto n’s position on the West Co ast. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 Long ago, Mark  Twain  said: “A m an who  tries to  carry a cat h ome by its tail will lear n a lesso n 
that can  be learned in no other way.”  If Twain were around now, he might try winding up a der ivativ es 
business.  After a few  days, he would opt  for cats. 
 
 We lo st $1 04 million pre-tax  last year in  our con tinuing atte mpt to exit Gen  Re’s derivative 
operation.  Our aggregate losses since we began this endeavor total $404 million. 
 
 Originally w e had 23,218 contracts ou tstand ing.  By th e start of 2005 we were dow n to 2,890.  
You might expect th at ou r losses wou ld have been stemme d by this point, but the blood h as kept flowing.  
Reducing our inventory to 741  contracts last y ear co st us the $1 04 million men tioned above. 
 
 Remember th at th e rationale fo r estab lishing this un it in 19 90 was Gen Re’s wish to  meet th e 
need s of insurance cl ients.  Yet one of the cont racts we liquidated in 2005 had a t erm of 1 00 years!  It ’s 
diffic ult to im agine what “nee d” such a contract coul d fulfill except, perhaps, the nee d of a compensation-
consciou s trader to h ave a lon g-dated contract o n his book s.  Long contracts, or alter natively th ose with 
multiple variables, are the m ost difficult to mark to m arket (the stan dard proce dure use d in accounting for 
derivatives) and  provide the most opportunity fo r “imagination” when trad ers are estimatin g their v alue.  
Small wo nder that trad ers prom ote them. 
 
 A business in which huge amounts of compensat ion flow from assum ed numbers is obviously 
fraught with danger.  When t wo traders execute a transact ion that has se veral, som etimes esot eric, variables 
and a far-o ff settle ment date, th eir resp ective firm s must subsequently value these co ntracts wh enever they 
calculate their earni ngs.  A gi ven c ontract may be val ued at one price by  Firm A and at  anot her by Firm B.  
You can bet that the val uation differences – and I’m personally fam iliar with  several that were huge – ten d 
to be tilted in a direction fa voring hi gher e arnings at each firm .  It’s a st range worl d in which two pa rties 
can ca rry out a paper transaction that each can promptly report  as profitable. 
 
 I dwell on our expe rience  in derivative s each year for two reas ons.  One is pe rsonal and 
unpleasant.  The hard fact is that I have c ost you a l ot of money  by not moving immediately to close do wn 
 10Gen Re’s trad ing operation .  Both Charlie an d I knew at  the time of the Gen  Re pu rchase th at it was a 
problem an d told its management that we wan ted to exit the business.  It was my resp onsibility to mak e 
sure t hat happened.  Rather than address t he situation hea d on, however, I wast ed se veral years w hile we 
attempted to sell the operat ion.  That  was  a doom ed en deav or beca use no real istic solution could have  
extricated  us from the maze of liab ilities th at was go ing to ex ist fo r decades.  Our obligation s were  
particula rly worrisom e because thei r pote ntial to explode could not be measured.  More over, if s evere 
trouble occurred, we knew it was lik ely to co rrelat e with prob lems elsewh ere in  financial markets. 
 
 So I failed  in my atte mpt to exit painlessly, and  in the mean time more trad es were put on the 
books.  Fau lt me fo r dithering.  (Charlie calls it thumb-suc king.)  When a problem exists, whet her in 
personnel or in bu siness operations, the tim e to act is now. 
 
 The seco nd reason  I reg ularly d escrib e our prob lems in this area lies in  the ho pe th at our 
expe riences may prove instructive for m anagers , auditors and re gulators.  In a sense , we are a canary in this  
business co al mine and should  sing  a son g of warning as we expire.  The nu mber and value of derivativ e 
contracts out standing in the world continues to mushroom and i s now a m ultiple of wh at existed in 1998, 
the last ti me that fin ancial ch aos erup ted. 
 
 Our e xperie nce should be  particularly sobering because we we re a better-tha n-ave rage candidate  
to exit gracefully.  Ge n Re was a  relativel y minor operat or in t he derivatives field.  It has had the good 
fortune to unwind its supposedly liquid positions i n a benign market, all the whi le free of financial or other 
press ures t hat might have forced it to conduct the liquidation in a less-than-efficient manner.  Our 
accounting in the past was conventiona l and actually thought to be conser vative.  Additionally, we know of  
no bad behavior by anyone involved. 
 
 It co uld be a differen t story for others in  the future.  Imag ine, if yo u will, o ne or more fir ms 
(troub les o ften spread) with  positions that are many multiples of ours atte mpting to liquidate in ch aotic 
markets and unde r extrem e, and well-publicized, press ures.  Th is is a s cenario to which much atten tion 
should be gi ven now rather than aft er the fact.  The t ime to have c onsidered – an d improved – t he reliability 
of New Orlea ns’ levee s was before Katrin a. 
 
 When we finally win d up Gen Re Securities, m y feelin gs about its d eparture will b e akin to tho se 
expressed  in a country son g, “My w ife ran aw ay w ith m y best friend, an d I sure miss him a lo t.”

 12• In both our building-products companies and  at Shaw, we continue to be hit by rising cos ts for raw 
materials and energy.  Most of these operations a re sign ificant users of oil (o r more sp ecifically,  
petrochemicals) and natural gas.  And prices fo r these co mmodities h ave soared. 
  
We, l ikewise, have raised prices on m any products, but there are often l ags be fore inc reases be-
come effect ive.  Nevertheless, both our building-products operations and Shaw delivered respect-
able resu lts in 2005, a fact att ributable to th eir strong business franc hises and able managements. 
 
• In apparel, ou r larg est u nit, Fru it of the Lo om, again incre ased earnings and m arket-s hare.  You 
know, of course, of our leadersh ip position in men’s and boys’ unde rwear, in which we account 
for about 48.7% of the sales recorde d by mass-m arketers (Wal-Mart, Ta rget, etc.).  T hat’s up from  
44.2% in 2002, whe n we ac quired the com pany.  Operating from a sm aller base, we have m ade 
still g reater g ains in intimate apparel fo r women and girls that is so ld by the mass-mark eters, 
climbing fr om 13.7% of t heir sales in 2002 to 24.7% in 2005.  A gai n like that in a major cat egory 
doesn’t com e easy .  Thank John Holland, Fruit’s extraordinary CEO, for making this happen. 
 
• I told you last year th at Ben  Brid ge (jewelry) a nd R. C. Willey (ho me furnishings) had same-store 
sales gai ns far above the average o f their industries.  You might think that blow-out figures in one 
year wo uld mak e comparison s difficu lt in the following year.  Bu t Ed and Jon  Bridge at th eir 
operation  and Scott Hym as at R. C. Willey were m ore than up to th is challen ge.  Ben Bridge had a 
6.6% same-store gain in 2005, and  R. C. Willey ca me in at 9.9%. 
 
Our never-on-Sun day app roach at R. C. Willey co ntinues to overwh elm seven-day competitors as 
we roll out stores in new m arkets.  The Bois e store, about which I was such a skeptic a few ye ars 
back , had a 21% gai n in 2005, coming of f a 10% gain in 2004.  Our new Reno store, opened in 
Novem ber, broke  out of the  gate fast with sales that exc eeded Boise’s early pace, a nd we will  
begin busine ss in Sacram ento in June .  If thi s store succeeds as I expect it to, Californians will see 
many more R. C. Willey sto res in the years to  come. 
 
• In flight services, ea rnings improve d at FlightSafety as c orporate aviation continued its rebound.  
To support growth, we invest h eavily in ne w sim ulators.  Our m ost recent expansi on, bri nging us 
to 42 training cen ters, is a major facility at Farn borough, Eng land that opened in September.  
When it is fully built ou t in 2007, we will h ave invested more th an $100 million in the building 
and its 15  simu lators.  Bru ce Whitman, Flig htSafety’s ab le CEO, m akes sure th at no competitor 
comes close to offering the breadth and depth of services that we do. 
 
Operating res ults at NetJets were a di fferent story .  I sai d last year th at this business would earn 
money in 2005 – and I was dead wrong. 
 
Our European operat ion, it should be not ed, showed both excel lent growth and a reduce d loss.  
Custom er cont racts there inc reased by 37% .  We are t he only fractional-ownership operation of 
any size in Euro pe, a nd our now-pervasive prese nce there is a key  factor i n making NetJets the 
worldwid e lead er in this ind ustry. 
 
Despite a la rge increase  in c ustom ers, however, our U.S. operation dipped far into the red .  Its 
efficien cy fell, and  costs soared.  We b elieve that our three la rgest co mpetitors suffered  similar 
problem s, but each is owne d by ai rcraft m anufact urers that may thi nk differently than we do a bout 
the necessi ty of m aking ade quate profits.  The combi ned value of the fleets managed by  these 
three c ompetitors , in any ca se, continues t o be less valua ble than the fleet that we  operate. 
 
Rich  Santulli, one of the most dynamic managers I’v e ever m et, will so lve our rev enue/expense 
problem.  He won ’t do it, howev er, in  a manner that impairs th e quality o f the NetJets ex perience.  
Both he and I are co mmitted  to a lev el of service, secu rity and safety t hat can ’t be match ed by 
others. 
 
 13• Our retailing category includes See’s  Candies, a c ompany we bought early in 1972 (a date making 
it our oldest non-insurance  business).  At that time, Charlie and I immediately deci ded to put 
Chuck Huggins, th en 46, in charge.  Thoug h we were new  at th e game o f selectin g managers, 
Charlie and  I hit a h ome run with this appo intment.  Ch uck’s love for the cu stomer and  the brand 
perm eated the organization, which in his 34-year tenure produced a m ore-than-tenfold increase i n 
profits.  Th is gain was ach ieved in an indu stry growing at b est slowly an d perhaps no t at all.  
(Volume figures in this industry are hard to pin down.) 
 
At yeare nd, Chuck turned the reins  at See ’s over  to Brad K instler , who pr eviously had served 
Berkshire well while running Cypress  Insurance a nd Fec hheimer’s.  It’s unusual for us to move 
managers a round, but Brad’s reco rd m ade hi m an obvi ous choice for the See’s j ob.  I h ope C huck 
and his wife, Donna, a re at the annual m eeting.  If they are, sha reholders can join Cha rlie and m e 
in giving America’s n umber one candy maker a richly-deserved round of applause. 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
 Every day, in countless ways, th e competitiv e position of each  of our businesses grows eith er 
weake r or stronger.  If we a re del ighting customers, el iminating u nnecessary  cost s and i mproving our 
products and services, we gain strength.  B ut if we t reat customers wi th indifference or tolerate bloat, our 
businesses will with er.  On  a daily basis, th e effects of our actio ns are im perceptible; cum ulatively, th ough, 
their consequences a re enormous. 
 
 Whe n our l ong-term  com petitive position improves as a  result of these almost unnoticeable  
actions, we des cribe the phenomenon as “wi dening the moat.”  An d doing that is essent ial if we are t o have  
the kind of bus iness we want a decade or two from  now .  We always, of course, hope t o earn m ore money  
in the sho rt-term.  But when short-term  and long-term  conflict, wid ening the moat must  take precede nce.  If 
a managem ent makes bad d ecisions i n order t o hit short-term earni ngs targets, and co nsequently gets 
behind the eight-ball in terms of cost s, customer sat isfaction or brand strength, no am ount of s ubsequent 
brillian ce will o vercome the damage that has b een inflicted .  Tak e a look at th e dilemmas o f managers in

only child, a decidedly homely and dul l lass.  R elieved, the fath er called  in his new so n-in-law after th e

“Tha nks, dad .”

“No problem, we have  lots of other spots in the business.   What  would you like to do?”

 A couple of la st year’s cha nges in our portfolio  occurred because of c orporate e vents: Gillette  was 
merg ed into Procter & Gam ble, an d American Exp ress s pun off Am eriprise.  In  addition, we sub stantially 
increased  our holdings in Wells Farg o, a co mpany that Dick  Kov acevich runs brillian tly, an d estab lished 
positions in Anheuser-Bu sch and Wal-Mart. 
 
 Expect no miracles fr om our equi ty portfolio.  T hough we own major interests in a number of  
strong, highly-profitable businesses, t hey are not  selling at  anything like bargain prices.  As a g roup, they 
may d ouble in value in ten years.  Th e likelihood is th at their p er-share earn ings, in aggregate, will g row 6-
8% per year o ver the decade and  that their sto ck prices will more or less match that growth .  (Th eir 
managers , of course, think my expect ations are too modest  – and I hope they’re right.)

 The P&G-Gillette merger, cl osing in the fourth qu arter o f 2005, requ ired Berk shire to  record  a 
$5.0 billion pre-tax  capital g ain.  Th is bookkeeping entry, d ictated  by GAAP, is mean ingless from an  
econ omic standp oint, and you should ignore it when  you are eval uating Berkshire’s 2005 ea rnings.  We 
didn’t intend to sell o ur Gillette sh ares b efore th e merger; we do n’t in tend to sell o ur P&G sh ares now; an d 
we inc urred no tax when the merger t ook place. 
 
 It’s h ard to overem phasize th e importance of who  is CEO o f a co mpany.  Befo re Jim Kilts arriv ed 
at Gillette  in 2001, the com pany was strugg ling, having particularly suffered  from cap ital-allo catio n 
blunde rs.  In the m ajor exa mple, Gillette’ s acquisiti on of Duracell cost Gillette sharehol ders billions of 
dollars, a loss never m ade visible by conventional accounting.  Quite simply, what Gillette  received in 
business value in this acquisition was  not equi valent to what it gave u p.  (Amazingly, this most 
fundamental of yardsticks is alm ost always i gnored by  both managem ents and their investment bankers  
when acqu isitio ns are und er discu ssion .) 
 
 
 
 15 Upon  taking office at Gillett e, Jim quickly in stilled  fiscal d iscipline, tig htened operations and 
energized marketing, m oves that dramatically in creas ed th e intrinsic v alue of the company.  Gillette’s 
merger with P&G the n expa nded the potential of bot h com panies.  For his accom plishments, Jim  was paid 
very well – but he earned e very pe nny.  (This is no acade mic evaluati on: As a 9.7% owne r of Gillette, 
Berk shire in  effect paid th at propo rtion  of his compensatio n.)  Indeed, it’s difficu lt to overpay th e truly 
extraordinary CEO of a giant enterprise.  B ut this species is rare. 
 
 Too often, executive compensatio n in the U.S. is ridiculously o ut of lin e with perform ance.  That 
won’t change, moreover , because t he deck  is stacked  against investors when it comes to the CEO’s pay.  
The u pshot is that a mediocre- or-worse CEO – ai ded by his handpicked VP of human rel ations and a 
consultant from the ever-acc omm odating fi rm of Ratche t, Ratchet and B ingo – all too often receive s gobs 
of money fro m an ill-d esigned compensation  arran gement. 
 
 Take, for instance, ten  year, fixed-price options (and who wo uldn’t?).  If Fred Futile, CEO of 
Stagnant, Inc., receives a bundle of these – let’s say enough to give him  an opti on on 1% of t he com pany – 
his self-in terest is clear: He sh ould sk ip dividends entirely and instea d use all of t he company’s earnings  to 
repurchase stock. 
 
 Let’s ass ume that under Fre d’s leade rship Stagna nt lives up to its n ame.  In each  of the ten  years 
after th e option grant, it earns $1  billion on $10 billion of net worth, which initially comes to  $10 per share 
on the 100 m illion sha res then outstanding.  Fred esc hews dividends and regularly uses al l earni ngs to 
repurchase sh ares.  If th e stock  constan tly sells at  ten times earn ings per share, it will h ave appreciated 
158%  by t he end of t he option period.  T hat’s because  repurchases  would reduce t he number of s hares to 
38.7 million by that time, and earnings per share  would ther eby increase to $25.80.  Simply by withho lding 
earni ngs f rom owners, Fre d gets very  rich, m aking a cool  $158 m illion, des pite the business i tself 
improving not at all.  Astonishingly, Fred coul d have m ade more than $100 million if Stagna nt’s ea rnings 
had declined  by 20% during the ten-year period. 
 
 Fred can also get a splendid resul t for himself by paying no dividends and deploying the earnings 
he withholds from share holders into a variety of disappointing projects and acquisitions.  Even if these 
initiativ es deliver a paltry 5% return , Fred will still make a bundle.  Specifically –  with Stagn ant’s p/e ratio 
remaining unc hange d at ten – Fre d’s option will deliv er him $63 m illion.  Meanwh ile, his share holders will 
wonder what happened to the “alignment of interests” that was s uppose d to occur when Fred was  issued 
options. 
 
 A “n ormal” divi dend policy, of co urse – one-third of ear nings pai d out, for e xample – pro duces 
less ex treme resu lts bu t still can  provide lush rewards for managers who  achieve nothing. 
 
 CEOs understan d this math and kno w that ev ery dime paid out in dividends reduces th e value of 
all outstanding options.  I’ve neve r, however, seen this manager -owner conflict refe rence d in proxy 
materials that request a pproval of a  fixed-pri ced option plan.  Though CEOs invariably preac h interna lly 
that capital comes at a cost, they so mehow forget to tell share holders that fixed-price opt ions give them 
capital th at is free.  
 
 It does n’t have  to be this way : It’s chi ld’s play for a b oard to desi gn options that give effect to the 
automatic build-up in valu e that occurs when ea rnings are retaine d.  But – surprise, surprise – options of 
that kind are almost never issu ed.  Indeed, the very though t of options with strike prices th at are adj usted 
for retained earni ngs seem s forei gn to com pensation “e xperts,” who are  nevert heless ency clopedic about 
every  manage ment-frie ndly plan t hat exists.  (“Whose bre ad I eat, his song I sing.”) 
 
 Getting fired can produce a par ticularly boun tiful payday fo r a CEO .  Indeed , he can “ear n” more 
in that sin gle day, wh ile clean ing out his desk, than an American worker ea rns in a lifetim e of cle aning 
toilets.  Forget  the old m axim abou t nothi ng succee ding like success: T oday, in the e xecutive s uite, the  all-
too-prevale nt rule is th at nothing succee ds like failure . 
 
 
 16 Huge severance pay ments, lavish perks and outsized payments for ho-hum perf ormance often 
occur b ecause comp committees h ave become slav es to  comparativ e data.  Th e drill is simple: Th ree o r so 
directors – not chose n by chance – are bombarded for a few hours before a b oard meeting wi th pay 
statistics th at perp etually ratch et upward s.  Additionally, t he committee i s told abou t new perks that other 
managers a re receiving.  In this manner, outlandis h “goodies” are showere d upon CEOs simply becaus e of 
a cor porate version of the argument we al l used when children: “But, Mom, all the other ki ds ha ve one.”  
When comp commi ttees fo llow th is “log ic,” yesterd ay’s m ost egre gious  excess bec omes today ’s baseline. 
 
 Comp commit tees shou ld adop t the attitu de of Hank  Greenb erg, the Detroit slu gger and  a boyhood 
hero of mine.  Hank’s son, Steve, at one time was a player’s a gent.  Repr esenting an outfielder in 
negotiations with a major league cl ub, Steve sou nded out his dad about the size of t he signing bonus he 
should ask f or.  Hank , a true pay-for-performance guy , got straight to the point, “What did he hit last year?”  
When Steve answered “.246,” Hank’s comeback was imm ediate: “As k for a uniform .” 
 
 (Let me pause for a brief con fession: In criticizin g comp commit tee behavior, I do n’t speak as a 
true insider.  Though I have served as a director of twenty public companies, only one CEO has put me on 
his comp commit tee.  Hmmmm .  . .)

 My views  on America’s long-term  problem in resp ect to trade imbalances, which I have laid ou t in 
previous reports, rem ain unchange d.  My conviction, however, cost Berkshire $955 million pre-tax in 2005.  
That amount is included in our earni ngs statement, a fact  that illustrates the differing ways in which GAAP 
treats g ains and  losses.  When we have a lo ng-term position in stocks or bond s, year- to-year changes in  
value a re reflected in our bal ance s heet but, as long as the asset is not s old, are rarely re flected in ea rnings.  
For example, our Coca-Co la holdings wen t from $1 billion  in value early o n to $13.4 billion at yearen d 
1998 and have since declin ed to  $8.1 billion – with  none of th ese m oves affecting  our earn ings statemen t.  
Long-term  currency positions, however, are d aily m arked to m arket an d therefo re hav e an effect on 
earni ngs i n every reporting period.  From the dat e we fi rst entered into currency contracts, we are  $2.0 
billion in th e black. 
 
 We re duced our direct position in c urrencies so mewhat during 200 5.  We p artially o ffset th is 
change, however, by purchasing equities who se prices are denominated in a variety of foreign  currencies 
and that earn a large part of their profits internationally.  Charlie and I prefer this method of acquiring non-
dollar exposure.  T hat’s largely because  of cha nges in interest rates: As U.S. rates ha ve risen relative to 
those of the rest of the world, holding most foreign currencies now involves a si gnificant negative “ca rry.”  
The ca rry aspect of our direct currency position indee d cost us m oney  in 2005 and is likely to do so again in 
2006.  In contrast, th e ownership of fo reign equities is lik ely, o ver time, to create a p ositive carry – perhaps 
a sub stantial one. 
 
 The underlying factors affecting the U.S. c urrent account deficit continue to worse n, and no letup 
is in sight.  Not only did our trade deficit – the large st and most familiar item in the current account – hit an 
all-time high in 2005, but we also can e xpect a secon d item – the bal ance of i nvestment income – to soon 
turn negative.  As f oreigners increase t heir ownership of U.S. assets (or of claim s against us) relative to  
U.S. inv estments abro ad, these in vestors will b egin earning more on their ho ldings than we do  on ours.  
Finally, th e third co mponent of the current acco unt, unilateral transfers, is always negative.   
 
 The U.S., it sho uld be emphasized , is ex traord inarily rich an d will g et richer.  As a resu lt, the huge 
imbalances in its curre nt account m ay continue for a long time without their ha ving noticeable deleterious  
effects on the U.S. eco nomy or on markets.  I doubt, however, that the situation will forev er rem ain benign.  
Either Am erican s add ress the p roblem soon in a way we select, o r at so me point the problem will likely 
address us in an unpleasant way of its own.  
 
 
 
 
 
 17How to Mini mize Investme nt Returns 
 
 It’s b een an easy matter for Berk shire an d other own ers of Am erican  equities to  prosper ov er the 
years.  Bet ween Decem ber 31, 1899 a nd Dece mber 31, 1999, to give a really lo ng-term  example, the Dow 
rose from 66 to 11,497.  (Guess wh at annual g rowth rate is requ ired to produce this resu lt; th e surpri sing 
answ er is at the end of this sect ion.)  This huge rise ca me about  for a simple reason:  Over the century 
American busi nesses di d ext raordinarily well and i nvest ors rode the wav e of their prosperity.  Businesses 
continue to do well.  Bu t now sh areho lders, th rough a series o f self-in flicted wounds, are in  a major way  
cutting the return s they will realize fro m their inv estments. 
 
 The exp lanation of how th is is h appening b egins with a fu ndamental tru th: With  unimportant 
exceptions , such as ba nkruptcies in whic h some of a com pany’s los ses are  borne by cre ditors, the most that 
owners in aggregate can earn between now and Judgment Day is what their businesse s in aggregate earn. 
True , by buying and selling that is clever or lucky, investor A m ay take m ore than his share of the pie at the  
expe nse of investor B.  And, yes, all invest ors feel richer when st ocks soa r.  But an owner can exit only by 
having someone take hi s place.  If one investor sel ls high, another m ust buy high.  For owners as a whole, 
there is sim ply no m agic – no showe r of m oney from  outer space – that will enable  them to extract wealth 
from  their companies  beyond that cr eated by the com panies them selves. 
 
 Indee d, owners must earn les s than their businesse s earn because of “fric tiona l” costs.  And that’s  
my point: These costs are now being inc urred in  amounts that will cause share holders t o earn far less th an 
they historically h ave. 
 
 To understand h ow this toll has ballooned, imagine for a moment that all Am erican  corporation s 
are, and  always will b e, owned by a sin gle fam ily.  We’ll call th em the Gotrocks.  After p aying taxes on 
dividends, this family – ge neration after generation – becomes richer by the aggregate amount earned by its 
companies.  Today  that am ount is about $700 billion a nnually.  Naturally, the  family spends s ome of these 
dollars.  B ut the portio n it sav es stead ily co mpounds for its benefit.  In  the Go trocks ho usehold everyone 
grows wealthier at the  same pace, and all is harm onious. 
 
 But let’s now assum e that a  few fast-talki ng Help ers approach the fam ily and persuade each of its 
members to  try to outsmart his relativ es by buying certa in of th eir holdings and  sellin g them certain  others. 
The Help ers – for a fee, of cou rse – ob ligingly ag ree to handle these tran sactio ns.  Th e Gotrocks still o wn 
all of c orporat e Am erica; the trades  just rearrange who ow ns w hat.  So the fam ily’s annual gain in wealth 
diminishes, e qualing the earnings of Am erican busi ness minus commissions paid.  The more that family 
members trade , the sm aller their sha re of the  pie a nd the larger t he slice received by  the Helpers.  This fact 
is no t lost upon th ese broker-Helpers: Activity is th eir friend and, in a wide variety o f ways, th ey urge it on . 
 
 After a while, most of the family members realize that the y are not doing so  well at th is new “b eat-
my-brot her” game.  Ent er another set of Helpers.  These newcomers explain t o each m ember of the 
Gotrocks clan that by himself he’ll neve r outsmart the rest of the fam ily.  The suggested cure: “Hire a 
manager – yes, us – an d get  the job done professionally.”  Th ese manager-Hel pers co ntinue to use th e 
broker-Hel pers to execute tra des; th e managers m ay even increase thei r activity so  as to  permit the brokers 
to prosper still m ore.  Ov erall, a b igger slice of the pie now goes to th e two classes of Helpers. 
 
 The family’s disappointment grows.  Each of its members is now em ploying professionals.  Yet 
overall, the group’s finances have taken a turn for the worse.  Th e solution?   More help, of co urse. 
 
 It arri ves in the form  of financial p lanners and  institutional consultants, who weigh  in to advise the 
Gotrocks on selecting m anager -Helpers.  The be fuddled fam ily wel comes this assi stance.  B y now its 
members know they ca n pick neither the right stocks nor the right stock-pickers.  Why , one might ask, 
should they ex pect su ccess in picking the righ t con sultant?  But this question does no t occur to the 
Gotrocks, and the consultant-Helpers certainly don’t suggest it to them. 
 
 
 18 The Gotrocks, now supporting three cl asses of expensive Help ers, fi nd that their results get worse, 
and they si nk into despair.  B ut just a s hope  seem s lost, a fo urth group  – we’ll call th em the hyper-Hel pers 
– appea rs.  T hese friendly fol k explain t o the Gotrocks that their unsatisfactory re sults are occurrin g 
because the existing Helpers – brokers , managers , consultants – are not s ufficiently motivated and a re 
simply going through the motions.  “ What,” the new Helpers as k, “ca n you ex pect from such a b unch of 
zombies?” 
 
 The new arri vals offer a breath takingly simple so lution: Pay more  money .  Brimmin g with self-
confide nce, the hyper-Hel pers assert that huge c ontinge nt paym ents – in addition to s tiff fixed fees – are  
what  each family member must fork over in order to really outmaneuve r his relatives. 
 
 The more observant members of the family see that some o f the hyper-Help ers are really ju st 
manager -Helpers weari ng n ew uni forms, beari ng sewn-on sexy nam es like HEDGE FUND  or PRIVAT E 
EQUI TY.  The new Helpers, however, assure the Gotrocks that this change of clothing is all-important, 
bestowing on its weare rs magical powers si milar to those acqui red by mild-mannere d Clark Kent  when he 
chan ged into his Superm an costume.  Calmed by this explanation, the family deci des to pay up. 
 
 And that’s where we are today: A rec ord portion of the earnings that would go in their entirety to 
owners – if they all j ust stayed  in their rocking chairs – is no w going to a swelling  arm y of Helpers.  
Particularly expensive is the recen t pandemic of profit arrangem ents under whic h Helpers receive large 
portion s of the winn ings when they are sm art or lu cky, and  leav e fam ily members with  all o f the losses –  
and large fi xed fees t o boot – when the Helper s are dum b or unl ucky (o r occasionally crooke d). 
 
 A su fficien t number of arran gements like this – heads, the Help er tak es much of the winn ings; 
tails, the Gotrocks lose a nd pay dear ly for the privilege of doi ng so – may make it more accurate to cal l the 
family the Ha drocks.  Today, in fact, the family’s fri ctional cost s of al l sorts may well amount to 20% of 
the earnings of Am erican business.  In ot her words, the burden of paying Helpe rs may cause Am erican 
equity in vestors, ov erall, t o earn  only 80% or so  of what they wou ld earn  if they just sat still an d listen ed to 
no one.

 Here ’s the ans wer to the question posed at the begi nning of this section: To get  very  specific, the

Debt and Risk  
 
 As we c onsolidate MidAm erican, o ur new balance s heet may suggest  that Berkshi re has expa nded 
its tolerance for borrowing.  But that’s not so.  Exce pt for token am ounts, we shun debt, turning to it for 
only three purposes:  
 
1) We occasional ly use re pos a s a part of ce rtain s hort-term  investing st rategies that incorporate 
ownership of U.S. governmen t (or ag ency) secu rities.  Pu rchases o f this kind are highly 
opportunistic and i nvolve only the most liquid of sec urities.  A f ew years ag o, we e ntered i nto 
several interest ing transactio ns th at have since been unwound or are runn ing off.  The offsettin g 
debt has likewise bee n cut substantially and before long may be gone. 
 192) We borrow money agai nst portfolio s of interest-bearing receivables whose risk cha racteristics we 
understand .  We did this in 2001 when we gu aranteed $5.6 billion  of bank debt to take over, in 
partnership wit h Leuca dia, a bankr upt Finova (which held a broa d range  of receiva bles).  All of 
that debt  has been repaid.  More rece ntly, we ha ve b orrowed to finance a wi dely-diversified, 
predictably-perform ing portfolio of m anufact ured-home receiva bles managed by Clayton.  
Alternatively, we c ould “ securitize” – that  is, sell – these  receiva bles, but re tain the  servicing of 
them.  If we fo llowed this pro cedure, which is co mmon in the industry, we wou ld not show th e 
debt that we do on our balance sheet, a nd we would als o accelerate the earni ngs we report.  In the  
end, however, we w ould earn less m oney .  Were market variables t o change s o as to fa vor 
securitizatio n (an  unlikely ev ent), we cou ld sell p art of our portfolio and eliminate th e related  debt.  
Until then, we prefer b etter pro fits to b etter co smetics. 
 
3) At Mid American , we have substantial d ebt, but it is th at co mpany’s obligation only.  Tho ugh it 
will appear on  our consolidated balance sh eet, Berk shire does not guarantee it. 
 
Even so, this debt is unquestionabl y secure beca use i t is serviced by MidAm erican’s diversified 
stream  of highly-stab le utility  earn ings.  If t here were to  be so me bolt fro m the blue that hurt one 
of MidAmerican ’s utility p roperties, earn ings from the others wo uld still b e more th an am ple to 
cove r all debt requirements.  M oreover, MidAm erican  retain s all of its earn ings, an  equity-
building practice th at is rare i n the utility field . 
 
 From a risk  standpoint, it is far safer to  have earn ings from ten diverse an d uncorrelated  utility  
operations that cove r interest char ges by, say, a 2: 1 ratio than it is to have fa r greater cove rage 
provided by a single utility.  A catastrop hic event can  render a si ngle utility insolvent – witness 
what Kat rina did  to the local electric u tility in New Orleans –  no matter h ow conservative its d ebt 
policy.  A ge ographical disaster – say , an e arthquake in a West ern state – can’t  have the sam e 
effect on MidAm erican.  And e ven a worrier lik e Ch arlie can ’t think of an event that wou ld 
syste mically decrease utility ear nings in any major way.  Because of MidAm erican’s e ver-
wide ning dive rsity of regulated earnings, it will always uti lize major am ounts  of debt. 
 
 And that’s abo ut it.  We are no t interested  in incurring an y significan t debt at Berk shire for 
acquisition s or operating  purposes.  Conv entional business wisd om, of cou rse, would argu e that we are 
being too conservat ive and that there are a dded profits that coul d be sa fely earned i f we injected m oderate 
leverage into our balance sh eet. 
 
 Maybe so.  B ut many of B erkshire’s hundreds of thousands of investors have a l arge portion of 
their net  worth in our st ock (among t hem, it shoul d be em phasized, a l arge number of ou r board and key  
managers ) and a disaster for the com pany would be a disaster for them .  Moreove r, there are pe ople who 
have been permanent ly injured to whom we o we insurance pay ments that stretch out for fi fty years or 
more.  To  these an d other con stituencies we h ave promised total secu rity, wh atever co mes: fin ancial panics, 
stock-exc hange closures (a n extended one occurre d in 1914) or even dom estic nuclear, chem ical or 
biological attacks. 
 
 We a re quite willing to acce pt huge  risks.  Indeed , more tha n any other insure r, we write high-lim it 
policies th at are tied  to sing le catastrop hic events.  We also  own  a larg e investment portfolio whose mark et 
value cou ld fall d ramatically and quickly under certain  conditions (as h appened on Octob er 19, 1987).  
Whatever occurs, tho ugh, Berkshire will h ave the net worth, th e earn ings stream s and the liq uidity to  
handle the prob lem with  ease. 
 
 Any other a pproach i s dangerous.  Over the years, a n umber of very smart peo ple have learne d the 
hard way th at a long string of im pressiv e numbers m ultiplied by a single zero always eq uals zero .  That is 
not an equation whose ef fects I wo uld like to experience pers onally, and I would like eve n less to be 
respon sible for imposing its penalties up on others. 
 
 
 
 20Manageme nt Succession 
 
 As owners, you are naturally concerned about whether I will in sist on  continuing as C EO after I 
begin to fade and, if so , how the board will han dle that  problem.  Yo u also wan t to know what happens if I 
should die tonight. 
 
 That second question is eas y to answer.  Most of our many busi nesses ha ve st rong m arket 
positions, sign ifican t momentum, and terrifi c managers.  The special Berk shire culture is deeply ingrained 
throughout our sub sidiaries, an d these op erations won’t m iss a beat whe n I die. 
 
 Moreover, we have  three m anage rs at Berkshire wh o are reason ably young and fully capable  of 
being CEO.  Any of the three w ould be much better at certain manage ment aspect s of my job t han I.  On 
the minus si de, none has m y cross over e xperience t hat allows m e to be comfortable making deci sions in 
either th e business aren a or in investments.  Th at problem will b e solved by having anoth er person in the 
organizatio n handle marketable securities.  Th at’s an  interestin g job at Berk shire, and th e new CEO wil l 
have  no problem in hiring a talented individual to do it.  Indeed , that’s what we have done at GEICO for 26 
years, and our resu lts have been terrific. 
 
 Berkshire’s board has fully discuss ed eac h of t he three CEO can didates and has unanimously 
agree d on the person who s hould succeed me if a repl acement were needed toda y.  The directors stay 
updated on this subject  and could alter their view as ci rcumstances cha nge – new m anage rial stars may 
emerge and presen t ones will ag e.  Th e important point is th at the directors know now –  and will always  
know in th e future – ex actly wh at they will do  when the need arises. 
 
 The other questio n that must be addressed  is wh ether the Board will b e prepared to make a ch ange 
if that need should arise not from my death but rathe r from  my decay, particularly  if this decay is  
accom panied by my delusionally thi nking that I am  reac hing ne w peaks of m anage rial brilliance.  That 
problem woul d not be uni que to me.  Charl ie and I have faced  this situ ation from t ime to time at 
Berks hire’s subsidiaries .  Humans age at greatly varyi ng rates – b ut sooner or later their talents and vigor 
declin e.  Some managers remain  effectiv e well in to their 80s – Charlie is a wo nder at 82 – and others 
noticeably fade in their 60s.  When their abilities ebb, so usually do their powers of self-assessm ent.  
Someone el se often needs  to blow the whistle. 
 
 When that time co mes for me, o ur board will h ave to step up to the job.  From a financial 
standpoint, its members are un usually m otivated to do so.  I kno w of no other board in the coun try in  which 
the financial interests of directors are s o completely aligned wi th those of shareholders.  Few b oards even 
come close.  On a personal level, howe ver, it is e xtraordinarily d ifficu lt for most people to  tell so meone, 
particularly a fr iend, that he or she is no longer  capable. 
 
 If I become a candidate fo r that message, however, ou r board will be d oing me a favo r by 
delivering it.  Every  share of Berk shire th at I own  is destined  to go to philanthropies, and I want s ociety to 
reap t he maximum good from these gi fts and bequests.  It woul d be a t ragedy  if the philanthropic potential 
of my holdings was d iminished because my asso ciates  shirked their respo nsibility t o (tend erly, I hope) 
show m e the door.  B ut don’t worry ab out this.  We have an outstan ding group of directo rs, an d they will 
alway s do what’s right for shareholders. 
 
 And while we are on the s ubject, I feel terrific. 
 
The Annual Meeting  
 
 Our m eeting this year will b e on Saturd ay, May 6 .  As always, th e doo rs will o pen at th e Qwest 
Center at 7  a.m., and the latest Berk shire movie will b e shown at 8:30.  At 9 :30 we will g o directly to  the 
question-and-an swer p eriod, which (with  a break for lunch at th e Qwest ’s stan ds) will last u ntil 3:00.  Then, 
after a sho rt recess, Ch arlie an d I will co nvene the annu al meetin g at 3:15.  Th is sch edule wo rked well las t 
year, because  it let those who wante d to attend the  form al session to do so, while freeing others to shop . 
 
 21 You certain ly did your share in  this resp ect last year.  Th e 194,300 square fo ot hall adjo ining the 
meetin g area was filled  with th e products of Berksh ire subsidiaries, and  the 21,000 people wh o cam e to the 
meetin g allowed every locatio n to rack up sales record s.  Kelly Bro z (neé Mu chemore), th e Flo Zieg feld of 
Berks hire, orc hestrates both this magnificent shopping extravaga nza and the m eeting itself.  T he exhi bitors 
love her, and so do I.  Kelly got married in October, and I gave her away.  She asked me how I wanted to 
be listed in the wedding program.  I replied “envious of the groom,” and t hat’s the way it went  to press. 
 
 This year we will showcase two Clayto n ho mes (featuring  Acm e brick, Shaw carpet, John s 
Manville in sulation, MiTek  fasten ers, Carefree awnings and NFM furnitu re).  You will find that these  
homes, pri ced at $79,000 and $89,000, deliver excel lent value.  In fact, three sha reholders cam e so fi rmly 
to that con clusion last year that th ey bought the $119,000 model we t hen showcased.  Flanking the Cl ayton 
homes on  the exhibition floor will b e RVs from Forest River. 
 
 GEIC O will h ave a boo th staffed  by a nu mber of its to p counselors from around the coun try, all of 
them read y to supply you  with auto insuran ce quotes.  In m ost cases, GEICO will b e able to give yo u a 
special shareholder discount (us ually 8%).  This sp ecial offer is perm itted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in 
which we operate.  (On e supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you  qualify fo r ano ther, such as 
that given cert ain groups.)  Bring the details of y our existing insurance a nd check out whet her we ca n save 
you m oney .  For at least 50% of you, I believe we ca n.  And while you’re at it, sign up for the new GEICO 
credit ca rd.  It’s the one I now use . 
 
 On Saturd ay, at the Omaha airpo rt, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets® 
availab le for your insp ection .  Stop  by the NetJets boo th at the Qwest t o learn a bout view ing these planes.  
Come to Omaha by bus; leav e in your  new plane. 
 
 The Bookworm  bouti que at the Qwest broke all rec ords last year selling Berk shire-related books .  
An amazing 3,500 of these were Poor Charlie’s Almanack , the collected wi sdom of my part ner.  This 
mean s that a co py was so ld every 9 second s.  And for good reaso n: You will never find a book with  more 
useful ideas.  Word-of-mouth recom menda tions have ca used Charlie’s first printing of 20,500 copies to sell 
out, and we wi ll therefore have a revi sed and expa nded edition on sale at our meeting.  Among t he other 22 
titles an d DVDs av ailab le last year at t he Book worm, 4,597 cop ies were so ld for $84,746 .  Our 
share holders are a bookseller’s dream . 
 
 An attachm ent to t he proxy  material that is encl osed w ith th is report explains how you  can obtain 
the cred ential yo u will n eed for ad mission to the meeting and other events.  As fo r plane, ho tel and car 
reser vations, we have a gain signed up American Ex press (800-799-6634) to give you special help.  Carol 
Pede rsen, who handles t hese matters, doe s a terrifi c job for us each year, a nd I tha nk her for it. 
 
 At Ne braska  Furniture  Mart, located on a 77-ac re site on 72nd Street between Dodge  and Pacific, 
we will ag ain be having “Berk shire Week end” pricing .  We in itiated  this special ev ent at NFM n ine years 
ago, and sales during the “Weeken d” grew from $5.3 m illion in 1997 to $27.4 million in 2005 (up 9% f rom 
a year earlier).  I get goose bumps just thinking abou t this volume. 
 
 To obtain th e discoun t, you  must make your purchases betw een Thu rsday, May 4  and Mo nday,  
May 8  inclusive, an d also  present your m eeting cred ential.  Th e period’s sp ecial p ricing  will ev en apply to 
the products of several  prestigious m anufact urers that normally have i ronclad rules aga inst discounting but 
that, in the spirit of our shareholder week end, have  made an exce ption for y ou.  We a ppreciate their 
cooperation.  NFM  is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m . Monday through S aturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p. m. on 
Sunday .  On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., we a re having a speci al affair for shareholders 
only.  I’ll be there, eat ing barbeque, drinking Coke, and counting sales. 
 
 Borsheim ’s again will have t wo shareholde r-only eve nts.  The first will be a coc ktail reception 
from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Frid ay, May 5 .  The second , the main gala, will b e from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. o n 
Sunday, May 7.  On Saturd ay, we will b e open until 6 p.m . 
 
 22 We w ill have h uge crow ds at Bo rsheim’s th roughout the weekend.  Fo r your con venience, 
therefore, sh areholder prices will b e available fro m Monday, May 1  through Saturd ay, May 1 3.  During 
that period, just identify yoursel f as a s hareholder through your m eeting c redentials or a brokerage 
statement.   
 
 Borsheim’s op erates on a gross margin that, even before the share holders’ discount, is fully twenty 
perce ntage points below that of its major ri vals.  Last year, our sha reholder-period business increased 9% 
from 2004, which cam e on t op of a 73% gain the year before.  The store sold 5,000 Berkshire Monopoly 
games – and then ran ou t.  We’ve learn ed: Plenty will b e in stock this year. 
 
 In a ten t outside of Borsheim’s, Patrick  Wolff, twice U.S. ch ess ch ampion, will tak e on all co mers 
in groups of six – blindfolded.  Add itionally, we will h ave Bob  Hamm an and Sh aron Osberg, two of th e 
world’s top bridge e xperts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon.  They  plan to keep 
their eyes open – but Bob never sorts his cards, eve n when playing for a national champions hip. 
 
 Gorat’s – my fav orite steak house – will again  be open exclu sively for Berk shire sh areholders on 
Sunday, May 7, and  will b e serv ing from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Please re member that to come to Gorat’s o n 
that day, you must have a reservation .  To make one, call 4 02-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before).   
 
 In this schoo l year, ab out 35 university classes will co me to Omaha for sessio ns with  me.  I tak e 
almost all – in  aggregate, perhaps 2, 000 students – to lunch at Gorat’s.  And they lov e it.  To  learn  why, 
come join us on Sunday . 
 
 We will again have a special r eception from 4:00 to 5: 30 on Saturd ay afternoon for sha reholde rs 
who have come from outside of North America.  E very year our meeting dra ws many people from around 
the globe, and Charlie and I want  to be sure we pe rsonally greet  those who have come so fa r.  Last  year we 
enjoyed meeting m ore than 400 of you from many dozen s of c ountries.  Any  shareholder who comes from 
other than the U.S. or Canada will b e given a special cred ential an d instructio ns for attend ing this function.

 Charlie and  I are ex traord inarily lu cky.  We we re born in America; had  terrific parents who saw  
that we go t goo d educatio ns; h ave enjoyed wond erful families an d great h ealth ; and  came eq uipped with a 
“business” gene that allows us t o prosper in a m anner hugely disproportionate to other people who 
contribute as much or m ore to our society’s well-being.   Moreover, we have l ong had jobs that we l ove, in 
which we are helped every day in  countless ways b y talented and chee rful associ ates.  No wonder we  tap-
dance t o work.  But nothing is more fu n for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at 
Berk shire’s annual meetin g.  So join us on May 6th at the Qwest fo r our annual Wood stock for Capitalists.   
We’ll see y ou there.
